#### Backbone Todo with TypeScript

I gave it a try for _Backbone.js_ by making todoMVC-lie app on
[this repository](https://github.com/hi-ogawa/backbone_test).
After that I overwrite it with _TypeScript_ to be familiar with it.
The app is working on [this github page](http://hi-ogawa.github.io/typescript_test).
And my blog post about this app is
[here](http://hi-ogawa.github.io/2015/07/30/typescript-tutorial/).
